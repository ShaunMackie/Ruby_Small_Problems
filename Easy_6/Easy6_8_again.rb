=begin

given an unordered array and the inforamton that exactly one value in the array occurs twice (every other value occurs once)
how would you determine which value occurs twice?
- write a method that will find and return the duplicate value that is known to be in the array

#Problem

#Input

an array

#Output

an integer representing the duplicate integer within the given array

#Examples

find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1

initailize a local variable to store the result of sorting the array
call each with index on the sorted array
if the current element == array[index + 1]
  return it
